How do I approach designing software?

Approaching designing software in this class required a lot of design thought and creativity in ways. These are relatively new design skills for me, which helped me be able to create a better scene, putting much thought into how I can best render and structure code to reach a goal. Tactics from my design approach that can be applied in the future would include things like working in iteration, drawing out my plans, and writing notes and saving code for later use when I knew I would need it.

How do I approach developing programs?

Strategies used in approaching developing this program included taking careful notes and sketches of things I knew would needed to be applied to later development of the project. My approach to developing the code in this course through the milestones changed drastically, as I became mor accustomed to the setup of the libraries and the structure of the library, leaving me with more time to work out the code than having to debug property and structure issues.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computational Graphics and vizualizations gave me new knowledge of code that can help me achieve my goals, such as how to setup libaries in C++, and how to properly notetake and structure in C++. This will help me in my professional career, as I can use these notes and structure to reflect and solve problems quicker.
